## React - Drag'n'Drop (No Library) + Pan/Scroll capabilities

This is an experiment to create a drag'n'drop utlising pointers instead of the web-API HTML5 Drag'n'Drop.

The benefits of using pointers is that you can add custom cursor options, in which, the usual drag'n'drop doesn't allow.

## How to use:

- Double-Click empty space to create a new 'node'
- Double-Click on a node to add text to an input
